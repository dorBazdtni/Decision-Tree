# Decision Tree Classifier
## <u> Introduction </u>
This project is an implementation of a Decision Tree algorithm for classification purposes. Decision Trees are a popular and interpretable machine learning technique used for both classification and regression tasks. In this assignment, you will learn how to build a Decision Tree classifier from scratch and apply it to classify data into different categories.

## <u> Purpose </u>
The main purpose of this project is to help you gain a deeper understanding of Decision Trees and their implementation. You will learn how Decision Trees work, how to construct them, and how they make decisions based on the features of the data. By the end of this assignment, you should be able to:

Understand the basic principles of Decision Trees.
Implement a Decision Tree algorithm for classification.
Learn how to handle data preprocessing and feature selection for Decision Trees.
Evaluate the performance of your Decision Tree classifier using appropriate metrics.
Gain insights into the interpretability of Decision Trees.

## <u>Conclusion </u>
By completing this assignment, you will have a solid understanding of Decision Trees and how they can be implemented for classification tasks. This knowledge will be valuable for further studies in machine learning and data science.
